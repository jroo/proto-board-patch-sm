# patch_sm proto board
Open source resources for jroo patch_sm proto board

While working on some new ideas, I put together this prototyping board to remove some of the hassle of prototyping modules on a breadboard. Components are much more stable and there’s a little patch bay up top to route from the Daisy Patch Submodule to these components however I like. Assuming it works like I hope and there’s interest, I’ll make some kits available in the next couple months. Design files, schematics and the Bill of Materials will be updated in this repo.
