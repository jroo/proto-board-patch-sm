While working on some new ideas, I put together this prototyping board to remove some of the hassle of prototyping modules on a breadboard. Components are much more stable and there’s a little patch bay up top to route from the Daisy Patch Submodule to these components however I like. Assuming it works like I hope and there’s interest, I’ll make some kits available in the next couple months. Design files, schematics and the Bill of Materials will be updated in this repo. 

### Future
- eurorack size compatibility/option to mount in rack
- provide more stability for desktop option by adding more standoffs
- more ground ports, more +3V3, fewer +5V
- i2c improvements, space for pullups, allow multiple devices
- ability to use ADC_9 TO ADC_12 for pots
